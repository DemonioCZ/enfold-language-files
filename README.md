# Submitting Translations
If you have a GitHub account (or do not mind creating one), you can easily submit your translations to us. 


1- Go to https://github.com/KriesiMedia/enfold-language-files and click "Fork" button 

![Fork image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5331416/197038042-15690550-98b3-4ed1-852b-35ba4ab5f5c1.png)


2- Please download the repository you have forked and use language files in it instead of language files inside Enfold/lang folder. This way, we are going to minimize the risk of overwriting files. 


3- Add your language files inside "lang" folder (please both .po and .mo files), upload fork and click "New Pull Request" button

4- Then click "Create Pull Request" button

6- Add the "Ready for merge" label (or as as a comment) when you are finished

7- We will review your pull request and merge them

8- Delete your fork after we merged your pull request - do not continue to work with that fork.

If you would not like to use GitHub, you can still submit your language files to [our forum](https://kriesi.at/support/topic/please-contribute-and-translate-enfold/). But always use the latest files from this repository and not theme files !!
